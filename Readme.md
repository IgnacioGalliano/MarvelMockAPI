</h1>

This mock was created to simulate the original Marvel API in cases such as when the original API is down or for unit tests, for example.

How to run?

1) Clone this repository
2) Run ```npm install``` in the root of the folder
3) Run ```npm start```. If the port 300 is free, it will start

If you want to use the original API <a href="https://developer.marvel.com/documentation/generalinfo">here is the link</a>

Thanks for read, bye!
